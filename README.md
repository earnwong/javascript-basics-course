# JavaScript Exercises

This repository contains exercises for learning JavaScript, covering fundamental concepts like variables, functions, loops, objects, and DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

## Running the Code

To run the code, it's recommended to use **VS Code Live Server**:

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code if you haven't already.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click on `index.html` (or the file you want to run) and select **Open with Live Server**.

This will open the project in your browser and reflect real-time changes as you edit the code.

## Committing Changes

After completing each exercise, commit your changes and push them to the repository using the following format:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "exercise1-finish"  # Change the number based on the exercise
git push origin main  # Replace 'main' with your branch name if different
```

Repeat this process for every exercise (`exercise2-finish`, `exercise3-finish`, etc.).
